<h1>Henry's Favorite Movies of 2023</h1>
<h2>A list of movies that I enjoyed this year.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Guardians Of The Galaxy 3</h3>
<p>Movie was a proper sendoff for James Gunn's wacky space family. Great character work that delved into the core aspects of the team and the emotional ties they've grown to have with each other. Villain was a menace who created tension and digust while also just not knowing if he would be calm or furious.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>One of Nolan's best films. The acting from the cast is solid and RDJ is definitely a contender for best supporting actor. Movie really captures the sense of existential dread that comes with not only having the knowledge of how to create a powerful weapon such as the atomic bomb, but the fallout of its use.</p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Colorful, funny and vibrant film that blends comedy with a strong message about gender dynamics, womanhood, and the female experience in society. Also, the movie has an interesting viewpoint on toxic masculinity and the effects it has on men when taken to extremes as well as a possible alternative.</p>
